# ðŸŽ¥ Film List ðŸŽ¥

[LINK TO APPLICATION](https://filmlist-project.netlify.app/)


## Description

### This project was made out of my love for films and cinema. I wanted to create a simple front-end heavy project that utilizes full CRUD functionality that gives the user the ability to add their favorite films or movies they haven't seen yet to their own watch-list. The application is built with React and Firebase. This was my first time creating a project using Firebase to store and fetch data. The UI is built with pure CSS and Framer-Motion for some of the animation as well as utilizing my own custom hooks to change the theme and color modes. One road block i ran into using Firebase i quickly found that there was no built in option for search filtering, so i had to use queries along with useHistory hook from React-Router in order to implement a search bar feature that filters through the Firebase data.

## Future Features

### Id like users to be able to share their own personal lists with friends via dynamic share links and also give access to friends so that they can add their own suggestions to the list. I will also be implementing a "Watched" section which will move any pre existing films that have already been watched by the user. Id like to also add a ratings list with what movies to watch in a specific order by rating. As for UI changes id like to implement a clean carousel instead of film cards and have a set of film stills that go along with each film.
